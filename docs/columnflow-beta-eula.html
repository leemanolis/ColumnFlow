Contact: lee.manolis@gmail.com

IMPORTANT—READ CAREFULLY. This Beta End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“You”) and the ColumnFlow developer (“we,” “us,” or “our”) governing Your use of the pre-release/beta version of the ColumnFlow mobile and desktop software application, related documentation, and any updates made available to You (collectively, the “App”). By installing, accessing, or using the App, You agree to be bound by this Agreement. If You do not agree, do not install or use the App.

1) BETA SOFTWARE; TESTING PURPOSES ONLY
The App is pre-release, is provided for testing and feedback only, and may contain bugs, errors, or incomplete features. The App is provided on a temporary basis and may change, break, or be withdrawn at any time without notice. DO NOT USE THE APP FOR MISSION-CRITICAL OR PRODUCTION PURPOSES.

2) LICENSE GRANT AND RESTRICTIONS
Subject to this Agreement, we grant You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the App solely for evaluation and testing on devices You own or control.
You shall not: (a) copy (except for reasonable backup), modify, translate, or create derivative works; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble except to the extent permitted by applicable law; (c) rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense; (d) remove or alter any notices; (e) use the App to infringe or violate third-party rights or law; or (f) use any hidden or undocumented interfaces.

3) OWNERSHIP
The App is licensed, not sold. We (and our licensors) retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the App and all associated intellectual property rights, subject only to the limited rights expressly granted in this Agreement.

4) PRIVACY; USER DATA; PERMISSIONS
(a) Local-First Design. Budget data You enter is stored on-device and, if You enable iCloud, in Your iCloud private database via Apple’s CloudKit. We do not operate our own servers for Your data.
(b) Optional Permissions. Calendar access is used only to create/update all‑day events You request. File access is used only for CSV import/export that You initiate. You can revoke permissions at any time in system settings.
(c) Diagnostics. The App may keep a lightweight, on-device event log. If You have opted-in with Apple to share diagnostics, we may receive anonymous/aggregated crash reports.
(d) Policy. Additional details are available in the ColumnFlow Privacy Policy.
(e) Your Responsibility. You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of Your own data.

5) FEEDBACK
You may provide feedback, suggestions, or bug reports (“Feedback”). You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Feedback for any purpose without restriction or compensation to You.

6) CONFIDENTIALITY
The App, features, and documentation are our confidential information. You agree not to disclose screenshots, recordings, or information about unreleased features to third parties without our consent, except for reasonable public beta feedback in the official discussion channels.

7) THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND TERMS
Use of iCloud/CloudKit and Calendar is subject to Apple’s terms and policies. You are responsible for compliance with applicable third-party terms when using those services.

8) APPLE-SPECIFIC TERMS (IF ACQUIRED VIA APPLE PLATFORMS)
(a) This Agreement is between You and us, not Apple. We, not Apple, are solely responsible for the App and its content.
(b) Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support.
(c) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no warranty obligations and no liability for claims relating to the App or Your possession/use, including product liability, legal/regulatory compliance, or consumer protection claims.
(d) In the event of a third-party claim that the App infringes intellectual property rights, we—not Apple—are responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of such claim.
(e) You represent that You are not in a country subject to U.S. Government embargo or on a U.S. Government list of prohibited parties.
(f) You must comply with applicable third-party terms when using the App.
(g) Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third‑party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may enforce it against You.

9) NO WARRANTY
THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

10) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (US $50). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; IN SUCH CASES, THE ABOVE LIMITS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED.

11) INDEMNITY
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from Your: (a) use or misuse of the App, (b) violation of this Agreement, or (c) violation of law or third-party rights.

12) TERM AND TERMINATION
This Agreement is effective until terminated. We may suspend or terminate Your access to the App at any time. You may terminate by deleting the App and (if desired) using the in‑app option to remove iCloud data. Sections 3–13 survive termination.

13) EXPORT AND SANCTIONS
You may not use or export the App except as authorized by U.S. law and the laws of the jurisdiction(s) where the App was obtained. You represent that You are not prohibited from receiving the App under applicable sanctions or export laws.

14) GOVERNING LAW; VENUE
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict of laws rules. Exclusive venue for any dispute shall be the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and You consent to personal jurisdiction there. If You are a consumer in the EEA/UK, You may have mandatory local consumer rights that supersede the foregoing to the extent required by law.

15) CHANGES
We may update this Agreement from time to time. The “Effective Date” above will be updated when changes are made. Continued use after changes signifies acceptance.

16) ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and us regarding the App and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
BY INSTALLING OR USING THE APP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.
